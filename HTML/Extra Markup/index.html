    <h1>Comments in HTML</h1>
    <p>If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text
        between these
        characters: &lt;! -- comment goes here -- &gt; It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter
        how familiar you
        are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at
        the code),
        comments will make it much easier to understand. Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser
        window,
        they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page. On a long page you will often see
        comments used
        to indicate where sections of the page start or end, and to pass on notes to help anyone who is looking at the
        code understand it.</p>

    <h1>ID Attribute</h1>
    <p id="example">Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from
        other elements on the
        page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is
        important that no two
        elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
    </p>

    <h1>Class Attribute </h1>
    <p class="example">Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely
        identifyingone element within
        a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the
        page</p>

    <h1>Block Level Elements</h1>
    <p>Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level
        elements. Examples of block elements are &lt; h1&gt; , &lt; p&gt; , &lt; ul&gt; , and &lt; li&gt; .</p>

    <h1>Inline Level Elements</h1>
    <p>Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as
        inline elements. Examples of inline elements are &lt; a&gt; ,&lt; b&gt; , &lt; em&gt; , and &lt; img&gt; .</p>


    <div>
        <h1>Grouping Text & Elements In a Block using div</h1>
        <p>The &lt; div&gt; element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.</p>
    </div>

    <span>
        <h1>Grouping Text & Elements Inline using Span</h1>
        <p>The &lt;span&gt; element acts like  an inline equivalent of the &lt; div&gt;
    </span>

    <h1>Escape Characters</h1>
    <p>There are some characters that are used in  and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the  left and right angled brackets.)
        Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters 
(also known as escape codes or entity references). For example, to write a left angled bracket, you can use either &lt; or 
&#60;. For an ampersand, you can use either &amp; or &#38;.There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as
 copyright and trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and some punctuation marks. For example, if you want to include
  a copyright symbol on a web page you can use either &copy; or &#169;  </p>

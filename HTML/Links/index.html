<h1 id="cricket">Cricket</h1>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
     pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking 
     the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side 
     tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each
      batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, 
      and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a 
      wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the 
      innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in
       international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.Forms of cricket 
    range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 
    fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days.
     Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic
      kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed 
      leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
     The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the
     British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the 
     International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. 
     The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed 
     primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.
     <h1 id="football">Football</h1>
     <p>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
        normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association
         football (known as soccer in North America and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
          Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying
           extent common origins and are known as "football codes".There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric
            ball games played in many different parts of the world.  Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of
            these games at English public schools during the 19th 
        century.The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
         influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
          Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain 
          their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
           associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular 
           team sports in the world.[

     <h1 id="tennis">Tennis</h1>
     <p>
        Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players
         each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over
          or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent 
          is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite 
          player will.Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone
           who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th 
           century as lawn tennis.[3] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to 
           the older racket sport today called real tennis.The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are 
           that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,[5][6] and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.
            A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge
             system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. Tennis is played by millions
              of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport.[10] The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to
               as the majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open, played on hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay
                courts; Wimbledon, played on grass courts; and the US Open, also played on hardcourts.
